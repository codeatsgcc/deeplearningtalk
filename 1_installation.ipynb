    "1. First, install Python 3.6 on your machine by following the instructions on the [offical Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/). Note that Keras will not run on the current version of Python (version 3.7); you must install a version of Python between 3.4 and 3.6  \n",
    "2. Next, download the Mac package manager `Homebrew` by following the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/). When this is done, the `brew` command will be available in `Terminal`, allowing you to install the packages available on the Homebrew repository\n",
    "3. Open up the `Terminal` application on your Mac and enter the following commands into your Terminal window. These commands install:\n",
    "    - the `graphviz` library to allow for the visualisation of graph/networks\n",
    "    - the Python packages `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` which allows for the organisation of the packages and dependencies needed to run Keras\n",
